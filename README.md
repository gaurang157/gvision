## Getting Started üåü
1. **Note: Before Installation**
It's recommended to create a new Python environment or Conda environment before installing GVISION. This will prevent potential conflicts with your existing dependencies and ensure a smooth installation process.

2. **Installation**
You can install GVISION using pip:
```bash
pip install gvision
```
# Global CLI
3. **Run GVISION**: Launch the GVISION application directly in the Command Line Interface (CLI).
```bash
gvision
```
